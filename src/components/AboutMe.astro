      Overthinker & problem solver — I’ve been writing software since I was 12
      (well, 14 if you don't count grinding Scratch as <em>writing software</em
      >), and kept practicing since then.
      <br />
      <br />
      My daily driver is an <b>Artix Linux</b> machine running the <b
        >Hyprland</b
      > compositor, I'm writing all of my code in a <b>Rust</b> based <b>Vim</b>
      like terminal editor on the <b>Alacritty</b> terminal emulator.
      <br />
      <br /> I am studying computer science in <b>Grenoble (France)</b>, and
      getting my teeth into as many different side-projects as I can manage in
      my free time
      <br />
      <br />

      Outside of that: I love climbing, video games and I’m learning Russian!
