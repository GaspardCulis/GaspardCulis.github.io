Overthinker & problem solver — I’ve been writing software since I was 12 (well, 14 if you don't count grinding Scratch as _writing software_), and kept practicing since then.

<br>

My daily driver is an **Artix Linux** machine running the **Hyprland** compositor, I'm writing all of my code in a **Rust** based **Vim** like terminal editor on the **Alacritty** terminal emulator.

<br>

I am studying computer science in **Grenoble (France)**, and getting my teeth into as many different side-projects as I can manage in my free time.

<br>

Outside of that: I love climbing, video games (Minecraft stan) and I’m learning Russian!
